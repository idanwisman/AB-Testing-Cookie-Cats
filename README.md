# AB-testing-Cats-And-Cookies
AB testing project to check whether a new feature  is needed to the mobile game Cats and cookies. 
This project contain one file which is the jupyter notebook where you can find the code.

I was checking wether the company lounch a new feature to the mobile game and checked the retantion rate before and after the change. I used the bootstrapping technique to measure if the change was succesful or not.
