# AB-Testing-Cookie-Cats
AB testing project to check whether a new feature is needed in the mobile game Cookie Cats. 
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook file where you can find the code.

Investigation of whether the company should launch a new feature in the mobile game and checked the retention rate before and after the change. I used the bootstrapping technique to measure if the change was succesful or not.
